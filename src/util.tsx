/**
 * A switch-case-like expression with exhaustiveness check. A bit like Rust's
 * `match`, but worse.
 *
 * If the given match arms are exhaustive, `Out` is returned. If they are not,
 * `Out | null` is returned, which you need to deal with explicitly. This helps
 * a lot with maintanence as adding a new variant to a union type will throw
 * compile errors in all places that likely need adjustment.
 *
 * ```
 * type Animal = "dog" | "cat" | "fox";
 *
 * const animal = "fox" as Animal;
 * const awesomeness: number = match(animal, {
 *     "dog": () => 7,
 *     "cat": () => 6,
 *     "fox": () => 100,
 * });
 *
 * const maybe: number | null = match(animal, {
 *     "fox": () => 100,
 * });
 * ```
