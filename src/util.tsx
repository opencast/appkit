/**
 * A switch-case-like expression with exhaustiveness check (or fallback value).
 * A bit like Rust's `match`, but worse.
 *
 * If the `fallback` is not given, the given match arms need to be exhaustive.
 * This helps a lot with maintanence as adding a new variant to a union type
 * will throw compile errors in all places that likely need adjustment. You can
 * also pass a fallback (default) value as third parameter, disabling the
 * exhaustiveness check.
 *
 * ```
 * type Animal = "dog" | "cat" | "fox";
 *
 * const animal = "fox" as Animal;
 * const awesomeness = match(animal, {
 *     "dog": () => 7,
 *     "cat": () => 6,
 *     "fox": () => 100,
 * });
 * ```
