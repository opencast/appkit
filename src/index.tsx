/**
 * Applies focus outline with a default width of 2.5px to elements. This should
 * always be used instead of a custom focus property to ensure consistency
 * throughout the design. If `({ inset: true })` is declared, the focus will be
 * on the inside of the focused element with a negative offset equal to the
 * outline's width. Otherwise is also possible to declare an additional offset
 * (usually 1) for elements with a similar color to the outline to make it
 * stand out more.
 *
 * In your application, you likely want to define your own wrapper for this with
 * a fixed first parameter:
 *
 * ```
 * import { focusStyle as appkitFocusStyle } from "@opencast/appkit";
 *
 * export const focusStyle = (options?: Parameters<typeof appkitFocusStyle>[1]) =>
 *   appkitFocusStyle(MY_APPKIT_CONFIG, options);
 * ```
 *
 * Where `MY_APPKIT_CONFIG` is what you pass to the `AppkitConfigProvider`, or
 * `DEFAULT_CONFIG` if you don't override the config.
